Nearly every component in the grill body is built using 18-gauge stainless steel, the kind of durable construction you need to emerge victorious from every BBQ and savor the moments that matter.</p><h4>Full-Featured Grill at an Affordable Price</h4><p>The double-lined hood, side walls, and fire box seal in heat, leading to steadier temperatures throughout the grill. Between the main grilling area and secondary warming rack, the 7-mm round steel cooking rods offer 626 square inches of cooking space; this is more than any in-class competitor can claim. Below the grill grates is a series of Triple Ridge Flame Tamers, which are uniquely shaped to spread even heat, keep flare-ups to a minimum, and afford even greater protection to the already-durable stainless steel burners. By centering the burners directly below the central ridges of the flame tamers, the Victory gas grill wicks drippings straight to a slide-out, full-width drip tray that makes cleanup incredibly simple.</p><h4>3 Burners <em>plus</em> an Infrared Searing Side Burner</h4><p>Each burner in this freestanding gas grill packs 12,000 BTUs, as does the infrared side burner that quickly preheats for steakhouse-style searing. Grillers seeking victory will also be glad to see a hood-mounted thermometer, an indispensable feature for keeping your eye on temperatures, and a battery-free piezo ignitor that reliably lights the burners.</p><h4>A Best-in-Class Grill Cart</h4><p>The Victory freestanding grill cart is fully enclosed for safe storage and a more finished look, while the left side shelf provides convenient prep space and beer placement for those who partake. Throw in 8 built-in tool hooks, heavy-duty locking casters for mobility and stability, and more than enough storage space for a propane tank, and this grill has features that go toe-to-toe with the best of them. So, are you ready to Taste Victory? Take winning BBQ into your own hands with the Victory gas grill.</p><div class=grid grid-gutter num-cols-sml-1 num-cols-med-3 num-cols-lrg-3 p-t-15><div class=col-sml-1 col-med-1 col-lrg-1 p-b-15><img src=https://cdn.shocho.co/sc-image/e/2/2/0/e2209a0ef5ae8f9b05901e06ead75519.jpg?i10c=img.resize(width:300,height:300) width=300 height=300 alt=All-Stainless Steel Design><h5 class=h6 m-b-0>All-Stainless Steel Design</h5><p class=m-t-0>For top-of-class quality, the Victory gas grills exterior is constructed entirely from durable, corrosion-resistant stainless steel.</p></div><div class=col-sml-1 col-med-1 col-lrg-1 p-b-15><img src=https://cdn.shocho.co/sc-image/0/6/9/2/06926b9490aeaa8f55dd9ed9e49f3971.jpg?i10c=img.resize(width:300,height:300) width=300 height=300 alt=Powerful Side Sear Burner><h5 class=h6 m-b-0>Powerful Side Sear Burner</h5><p class=m-t-0>The 12,000-BTU infrared side sear burner quickly and intensely sears up to 2 steaks at once  without taking up main grilling space.</p></div><div class=col-sml-1 col-med-1 col-lrg-1 p-b-15><img src=https://cdn.shocho.co/sc-image/4/6/6/9/466983216377ae8087cd773e802bd13c.jpg?i10c=img.resize(width:300,height:300) width=300 height=300 alt=Largest-In-Class Grilling Area><h5 class=h6 m-b-0>Largest-In-Class Grilling Area</h5><p class=m-t-0>Victorys 464 square inches of main grilling space are the most in class, with 162 square inches of secondary space on the top grate.</p></div><div class=col-sml-1 col-med-1 col-lrg-1 p-b-15><img src=https://cdn.shocho.co/sc-image/4/3/d/e/43de7e2787bfeff4a7e53f7e257adfa1.jpg?i10c=img.resize(width:300,height:300) width=300 height=300 alt=Triple Ridge Flame Tamers><h5 class=h6 m-b-0>Triple Ridge Flame Tamers</h5><p class=m-t-0>Uniquely engineered to evenly distribute high heat, greatly reduce flare-ups, and better protect the stainless steel burners below.</p></div><div class=col-sml-1 col-med-1 col-lrg-1 p-b-15><img src=https://cdn.shocho.co/sc-image/6/f/c/2/6fc27c10e132042e136e24188edca051.jpg?i10c=img.resize(width:300,height:300) width=300 height=300 alt=Fully Enclosed Storage Cart><h5 class=h6 m-b-0>Fully Enclosed Storage Cart</h5><p class=m-t-0>As sturdy as it is spacious, the Victory grill cart offers secure storage for propane tanks and more while providing a finished look.</p></div><div class=col-sml-1 col-med-1 col-lrg-1 p-b-15><img src=https://cdn.shocho.co/sc-image/a/b/b/2/abb232ea45d0b9fcf0154e4c914a9021.jpg?i10c=img.resize(width:300,height:300) width=300 height=300 alt=Convenient Tool Hooks><h5 class=h6 m-b-0>Convenient Tool Hooks</h5><p class=m-t-0>A set of 8 grilling accessory hooks 4 on each side shelf allows grillers to keep tongs, spatulas, and more within arms reach.</p></div></div><h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

This gold medal winning grill has been named Best Pedestal Propane Barbeque by the American Culinary Institute, and the reasons why are clear. 100 percent 304 stainless steel construction stands the test of time, and the mirror finish outshines other backyard grills. The double-lined lid and bowl do an excellent job at holding in heat, while also keeping the outside cooler and protecting against discoloration from heat. A cast stainless steel Stay-Cool handle lets you safely open and close the lid, which is perfectly balanced so as not to slam shut. Magma uses a patented design to create efficient convection cooking, providing the hottest temperatures while consuming the least amount of fuel. The Turbo Burner design creates a consistently hot blue flame by premixing air and fuel, producing up to 10,700 BTUs. A radiant plate helps to evenly distribute heat over the 201 sq. inch cooking surface as well as reduce flareups, extending the life of your grill. The hide-away control panel contains the flame control knob and push-button piezoelectric ignition, giving the grill a streamlined appearance when not in use. Adjustable feet on the base keep the grill level and safe. The grill comes equipped to use 1 lb propane canisters, and the regulator is mounted on a swiveling receptacle to make access even easier. It is shipped fully assembled - simply hook up a propane canister, turn it on, and start grilling.

The Weber Crafted porcelain enameled cooking grates provide 513 square inches of cooking area, and the warming rack gives you an additional 127.5 square inches for a total grilling area of 640.5 square inches.  The removable drip pan attaches to the grease tray for seamless cleanup.  Looks aren't everything, but they sure help.  The Weber GENESIS E-315 gas grill sports a revamped control panel, starting with a slight angle for modern aesthetics and ease of use.  The burner knobs follow suit, swapping the plastic construction from Weber Genesis II for metallicized knobs that lend a premium feel, not to mention greater durability.  As a bonus, each knob is notched with small-spaced tick marks for a more precise flame control.  That brings us to the T-bar handle, which is shaped for easy gripping, opening, and closing from any angle.  Weber reimagined everything for the new GENESIS grills, all the way down to the wheels.  They've been upgraded to metal, rubber tread casters, as opposed to the pair of plastic locking casters.  The rubber tread guarantees smooth transport, sturdier materials improve longevity, and the push-down lock mechanism lets you secure your grill in place with minimal effort.  Any Weber warranty, coupled with the company's outstanding track record of customer service, brings major peace of mind for backyard grillers.  Weber extended their limited warranty to 12 years on the new Genesis grills, as opposed to a 10-year period for Genesis II.  Now THAT is peace of mind.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Weber Genesis E-325 delivers just that with its extra-large sear zone and reliable burner system that effectively distributes heat for even cooking. FLAVORIZER Bars under the porcelain-enameled cooking grates both prevent flare-ups and produce flavorful smoke that infuses your food. Its compatibility with the Weber Crafted&#174; Outdoor Kitchen Collection allows you the freedom to experiment with different cooking styles. Available in natural gas or liquid propane, so you can conveniently experience Weber's best in your backyard.</p><h3>Experience Consistent Heat With PureBlu Burner Technology</h3><p>The Genesis E-325's PureBlu burner system features 3 unique, tapered burner tubes that generate consistent pressure and deliver even heat across the 513 square inches of grilling surface. That's 3 burners at 13,000 BTU each, for a total of 39,000 BTUs for efficient power. Flames are directed above the raised gas ports, while food debris falls below, minimizing clogging and ensuring the grill lights every time.</p><p>This innovative design not only helps maintain reliable ignition but also contributes to longer burner life and reduced maintenance over time. Whether you're searing steaks or slow-cooking ribs, you'll enjoy steady, high-performance heat across the entire grill.</p><h3>Achieve Restaurant-Quality Sear Marks With Porcelain Grates</h3><p>Porcelain-enameled, cast-iron cooking grates retain heat for intense searing that results in restaurant-quality sear marks. The porcelain coating prevents sticking and rust, making cleanup easy while also extending the life of your grill grates. These durable grates distribute heat evenly across the cooking surface, helping to eliminate hot spots and ensure consistent results. Sear with confidence, knowing your food will come off the grill with a perfect finish and rich, caramelized flavor.</p><h3>Enhance Flavors Naturally With FLAVORIZER Bars</h3><p>FLAVORIZER Bars protect your Genesis E-325's burners from grease, distribute heat evenly across the grill surface, and turn drippings into flavorful smoke that enhances your food. Made from quality stainless steel, these bars are designed for lasting durability. By vaporizing juices before they reach the flame, they help prevent flare-ups while adding that unmistakable grilled taste. They're also easy to clean and simple to replace, making them a convenient upgrade for any backyard chef.</p><h3>Simplify Cleanup With an Efficient Grease Management System</h3><p>All the fun of cooking delicious outdoor meals without the hassle of a difficult cleanup. Weber's grease management system, with a pull-out grease tray, is located directly under the cookbox and slides out for quick and easy disposal. The system is designed to catch drippings efficiently, helping to prevent flare-ups and keep your grill cleaner between uses. It's a smart solution that lets you spend less time scrubbing and more time enjoying the meal.</p><h3>Expand Your Culinary Options With Weber Crafted&#174; Accessories</h3><p>The Genesis E-325 is compatible with the Weber Crafted&#174; Outdoor Kitchen Collection. Roast, bake, sear, steam and even stir-fry by simply replacing the standard grate with any of the custom-fit grillware! The Weber Crafted&#174; frame and grillware are sold separately, so do not forget to add them to your purchase if you want to wield virtually limitless culinary power in your backyard. From wood-fired pizza to sizzling fajitas and delicate seafood, this innovative system opens the door to dishes you never thought possible on a gas grill. With Weber Crafted&#174;, your backyard becomes your favorite new kitchen.</p><h3>Keep Essentials Within Reach on Spacious Side Tables</h3><p>Fitted with two sturdy side tables, you'll enjoy plenty of space to prep, organize and plate. In other words, everything is within arm's reach - including tools, which can be hung on the side-attached hooks. Whether you're flipping burgers or slicing vegetables, you'll appreciate the convenience of having a dedicated surface for every step. These side tables are built to handle the heat of cooking and the weight of your go-to gear, making your outdoor setup feel more like a fully equipped kitchen.</p><h3>Maintain Food Temperature With a Convenient Warming Rack</h3><p>A sturdy warming rack allows you to instantly go from direct to indirect heat, so you can keep foods warm, toast buns, or even grill smaller food items while the main course finishes grilling below. It's perfect for keeping cooked food at serving temperature without overcooking. The elevated position also frees up space on the main grates, giving you even more room to multitask like a real pro.</p><h3>Enjoy Long-Term Reliability With a 12-Year Warranty</h3><p>Weber backs the Genesis E-325 with a 12-year limited warranty, giving you peace of mind with every cookout. From the cookbox to the lid assembly and burner tubes, key components are covered to ensure years of reliable performance. This long-term protection speaks to Weber's confidence in the durability and craftsmanship of their grills. It's a commitment that lets you focus on grilling - not worrying about what happens if something goes wrong.</p><h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Weber Slate cooktops are made differently than other griddles. The carbon-steel gets transformed under extreme heat and pressure that case hardens and bonds the surface, reducing the ability for moisture to collect and rust to form. It is then pre-seasoned with food-safe oils that condition the metal for an extra boost of rust resistance and a natural, easy-release cooking surface right out of the box. No use of coatings means you can use metal tools to flip, press, and scrape without worry. It reaches over 500 F and heats evenly edge-to-edge for consistently cooked food across the cooktop. Plus, with the Weber Works Prep, Cook, and Store System you can keep cooking and cleaning supplies handy, carry food and condiments from the kitchen to the griddle, convert the side table into a prep station and stow gear in tightly sealed containers (accessories sold separately).<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The newly designed GENESIS gas grill features our largest and hottest sear zone, with secondary cooking grate so that the main course and sides are all grilled and served at the same time. Once the food is ready, easily transfer it to the large prep & serve table, making for a seamless prep-to-serve grilling experience. The grease management system got a facelift as well: the removable drip pan is now attached to the grease tray for a seamless cleanup, with an included scraper just for good measure. The PureBlu burner system sets this grill apart from the pack - featuring unique, tapered burner tubes that generate consistent pressure and deliver even heat across the 513 sq. inches of grilling surface. Flames are directed above the raised gas ports, while food debris falls below minimizing clodding and ensuring the grill lights every time. Saute your favorite veggies, boil corn, or heat sauces on the side burner. Thanks to the WEBER CRAFTED Outdoor Kitchen Collection, the Weber GENESIS E-330 is so much more than a gas grill. This innovative line of custom-fit grillware slides in place of the standard grates enabling you to execute cooking styles from roasting and baking to steaming and even stir-frying. The culinary possibilities are virtually limitless! Though the WEBER CRAFTED line is sold separately, the GENESIS E-335 natural gas grill features a grill locker for storing every piece of grillware in addition to large BBQ tools.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Weber Genesis S-335 delivers just that with a premium design featuring a reliable burner system that effectively distributes heat for even cooking. FLAVORIZER Bars under the porcelain-enameled cooking grates both prevent flare-ups and produce flavorful smoke that infuses your food. Its compatibility with the Weber Crafted&#174; Outdoor Kitchen Collection allows you the freedom to experiment with different cooking styles. Available in natural gas or liquid propane, so you can conveniently experience Weber's best in your backyard.</p><h3>Sear Multiple Steaks With the Extra-Large Sear Zone</h3><p>The Weber Genesis S-335 features an extra-large sear zone designed to deliver restaurant-quality results right in your backyard. This high-heat area lets you cook multiple steaks at once, creating bold, flavorful sear marks with ease. Whether you're hosting a weekend cookout or just craving a perfectly charred burger, the expanded sear zone gives you the power and space to do it all. It heats up fast and maintains consistent temperatures, so you can focus on grilling like a pro without missing a beat.</p><h3>Enjoy Even Heat Distribution With PureBlu Burners</h3><p>The PureBlu burner system in the Genesis S-335 features 3 unique, tapered burner tubes that generate consistent pressure and deliver even heat across the 513 square inches of grilling surface. That's 3 burners at 13,000 BTU each, for a total of 39,000 BTUs for efficient power. Flames are directed above the raised gas ports, while food debris falls below, minimizing clogging and ensuring the grill lights every time.</p><p>This burner system not only helps maintain reliable ignition but also contributes to longer burner life and reduced maintenance over time. Whether you're searing steaks or slow-cooking ribs, you'll enjoy steady, high-performance heat across the entire grill.</p><h3>Enhance Flavors With Stainless Steel FLAVORIZER Bars</h3><p>FLAVORIZER Bars protect your Genesis S-335's burners from grease, distribute heat evenly across the grill surface, and turn drippings into flavorful smoke that enhances your food. Made from quality stainless steel, these bars are designed for lasting durability. By vaporizing juices before they reach the flame, they help prevent flare-ups while adding that unmistakable grilled taste. They're also easy to clean and simple to replace, making them a convenient upgrade for any backyard chef.</p><h3>Simplify Cleanup With the Grease Management System</h3><p>You can now enjoy delicious outdoor meals without the hassle of difficult cleanup, thanks to Weber's grease management system. A pullout grease tray is located directly under the cookbox and slides out for quick, easy disposal. This efficient design helps reduce flare-ups and keeps your grill operating at its best. That means more time grilling and spending time out back with friends and family, and less time cleaning up.</p><h3>Expand Your Culinary Options With Side Burner and Warming Rack</h3><p>The side burner on the Weber Genesis S-335 expands your outdoor cooking possibilities. Conveniently cook sauces, saut&#233; vegetables or simply boil a pot of water - whatever you would normally have to run inside for is now within arm's reach. Plus, in addition to multitasking, a side burner offers temperature control for delicate dishes that need more precise heat than the grill surface can accommodate.</p><p>The warming rack allows you to quickly switch from direct to indirect heat, so you can keep foods warm, toast buns, or even grill smaller food items while the main course finishes grilling below. It's perfect for keeping cooked food at serving temperature - and do so without overcooking. The elevated position also frees up space on the main grates, giving you even more room to multitask like a real pro.</p><h3>Maximize Storage With the Built-In Grill Locker</h3><p>A built-in grill locker adds convenience, organization, and protection to your outdoor cooking space. It provides a dedicated spot to store essential tools like tongs, spatulas, and grill brushes, so everything you need is always nearby. By keeping gear tucked away and protected from the elements, it helps reduce wear and tear while keeping your grilling area clean and clutter-free. It also saves you trips back and forth to the kitchen, making it easier to grill on a whim. For a more streamlined, ready-to-cook setup, a built-in grill locker is a smart, space-saving addition.</p><h3>Upgrade Your Grilling With Weber Crafted&#174; Compatibility</h3><p>The Genesis S-335 is compatible with the Weber Crafted&#174; Outdoor Kitchen Collection. Roast, bake, sear, steam and even stir-fry by simply replacing the standard grate with any of the custom-fit grillware! The Weber Crafted&#174; frame and grillware are sold separately, so do not forget to add them to your purchase if you want to wield virtually limitless culinary power in your backyard. From wood-fired pizza to sizzling fajitas and delicate seafood, this innovative system opens the door to dishes you never thought possible on a gas grill. With Weber Crafted&#174;, your backyard becomes your favorite new kitchen.</p><h3>Benefit from Long-Term Durability With Generous Warranties</h3><p>Weber backs the Genesis S-335 with a 12-year limited warranty, giving you peace of mind with every cookout. From the cookbox to the lid assembly and burner tubes, key components are covered to ensure years of reliable performance. This long-term protection speaks to Weber's confidence in the durability and craftsmanship of their grills. It's a commitment that lets you focus on grilling - not worrying about what happens if something goes wrong.</p><h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The newly designed GENESIS gas grill features our largest and hottest sear zone, with secondary cooking grate so that the main course and sides are all grilled and served at the same time. Once your food is ready, easily transfer it to the large prep & serve table, making for a seamless prep-to-serve grilling experience. The <b>grease management system</b> got a facelift as well: the removable drip pan is now attached to the grease tray for seamless cleanup, with an included scraper just for good measure.</p><h4>Updated Control Panel: Cleaner Look, Better Precision</h4><p>Looks aren't everything, but they sure help. The newly designed Weber GENESIS E-435 gas grill sports a revamped control panel, starting with a slight angle for modern aesthetics and ease of use. The burner knobs follow suit, swapping the plastic construction from Weber Genesis II for metallicized knobs that lend a premium feel, not to mention greater durability. As a bonus, each knob is notched with small-spaced tick marks for more precise flame control. That brings us to the T-bar handle, which is shaped for easy gripping, opening, and closing from any angle. And speaking of angles, the T-handles 90-degree corners enhance the modern look of Weber GENESIS gas grills.</p><h4>4 Stainless Steel Burners</h4><p>Get 48,000 BTUs of surface grilling power for a 646 square inch main grilling area. That's big enough to grill 28 burgers at a time!</p><h4>Side Burner</h4><p>Saute vegetables, boil corn, or heat up sauces with the 12,000 BTU side burner.</p><h4>Taller, Bolder Grill Lid</h4><p>Weber increased the height of these grill lids, a welcome change that goes beyond pure aesthetics. New GENESIS grills can fit rotisseries up to 10 in diameter without removing the top grate. It seems like a small detail, but it's just one more way the next generation of Weber GENESIS grills improve your outdoor cooking experience.</p><h4>The Ultimate Versatility of WEBER CRAFTED Grillware</h4><p>At this point, it would be fair to wonder if there was anything the Weber GENESIS E-435 propane grill is incapable of doing. Well, we have some big news on that front: compatibility with <a href={pathFor action='category' id='24149'}>WEBER CRAFTED Outdoor Kitchen Collection grillware</a> allows you to cook food never thought possible on a gas grill. Roast, bake, sear, steam, and even stir-fry by simply replacing the standard grate with any of the custom-fit grillware! And with the Weber GENESIS E-435 gas grill, you are already one step closer to the full backyard culinary experience thanks to the frame kit being built in (though the grillware itself is sold separately). </p><h4>Intergated Grill Locker</h4><p>A solution to all your grilling storage needs, the grill locker fits WEBER CRAFTED grillware, as well as your large grilling tools</p><h4>Upgraded Caster Wheels</h4><p>Weber reimagined everything for the new GENESIS grills, all the way down to the wheels. They've been upgraded to metal, rubber tread casters, as opposed to the pair of plastic locking casters on Genesis II grills. The rubber tread guarantees smooth transport, sturdier materials improve longevity, and the push-down lock mechanism lets you secure your grill in place with minimal effort.</p><h4>Longer Warranty</h4><p>Any Weber warranty, coupled with the company's outstanding track record of customer service, brings major peace of mind for backyard grillers. That said, Weber extended their limited warranty to 12 years on the new GENESIS grills, as opposed to a 10-year period for Genesis II. Now THAT's peace of mind!</p><br><h3 class=pt10>Weber GENESIS E-435 FAQ</h3><h5>How big is the Weber GENESIS E-435 gas grill?</h5><p>The E-435 is 68.5-in wide with both shelves up, 27-in deep, and 48.5-in high.

Period. The combination of advanced features and smartphone monitoring and control gives you power to control the smoke and heat, and keeps you posted on the progress of your cooking. Not since Fred threw a dinosaur rib on an open fire has outdoor cooking been more appealing!</p><h3>Smoke Box</h3><p>If you want a little more smoke and more smoke flavor than you may get with pellets alone, the reinvented Smoke Box lets you cook with wood pellets, wood chunks or chips, and even charcoal. Use the damper to simultaneously control heat and flavor. </p><h3>Down & Out Ventilation</h3><p>The Woodwind Pro heat diffuser optimizes your smoking by pushing smoke and heat up the sides of the grill, then circulating and eventually exiting it through the rear exhaust. You will get even heat and smoke throughout the smoking chamber. With the Fan Only mode, you can cold smoke with the Woodwind Pro 36. </p><h3>WiFi Controller + Camp Chef Connect</h3><p>The Woodwind Pro WiFi line includes a full-color display with an easy-to-use menu dial, four ports for temperature probes, and a weather-resistant cover. The Camp Chef Connect app lets you monitor your cook from anywhere on your smartphone. You can set timers, check data from past cooks, assign labels to your probes, and set up push notifications. The included Smart Meat Assistant even lets you select meat types. It does not get much easier than this! </p><h3>Smoke Number</h3><p>The PID controller helps you regulate smoke and temperature. You can control how much smoke you provide to your cook by adjusting the Smoke Number. The detailed controller gives you the most precise grill temperature control in the industry. Increase the Smoke Number, and your smoke output increases. As the Smoke Number decreases, the temperatures will hold steady. Now you can ask your friends, what is YOUR smoke number? </p><h3>Stainless Steel Components</h3><p>Protecting your grill against rust and corrosion helps it last for many years. The Woodwind Pro 36 uses 430 stainless steel on the inside, and the butterfly valve, gasket, and burn cup use 304 stainless steel. </p><h3>Sidekick Compatible</h3><p>Expand your outdoor cooking capabilities by adding a <a href=/i/3048807>Sidekick Flat Top griddle</a> or a <a href=/i/3081479>Sidekick Searing Station</a> to your pellet grill. A Sidekick mounts easily to your existing side shelf holes. The Sidekick components are propane-powered. </p><h3>Ash Cleanout</h3><p>While hardwood pellets typically burn efficiently, they usually leave some ash behind. The Woodwind Pro 36 provides an Ash Cleanout to let you quickly and easily remove ash. Simply pull the Ash Cleanout knob on the side of the grill, and your ash empties into a cup that you can remove. Just dump the ash safely, replace the cup, and you are ready for your next cook! </p><br><h3 class=pt10>Camp Chef Woodwind 36 Pro FAQ</h3><h4>Can you grill on a Camp Chef Woodwind Pro 36?</h4><p>You sure can! The Woodwind 36 Pro reaches a high temperature of 500 degrees F, which is hot enough to sear a steak and grill with no problem. As a bonus, you get real hardwood flavor for delicious results.</p><h4>How big is the Camp Chef Woodwind 36?</h4><p>The Woodwind Pro 36 is 62-in wide, 26-in deep, and 44.5-in high. It weighs 220 lbs.

Made with 304 Stainless Steel, the Built-in 500 grill is durable and stylish, laser-focused on performance. </p><h4>4 Stainless Steel Burners </h4><p>Burners are the heart of any gas grill. Napoleon's 16-gauge premium 304 stainless steel burner tubes are reinforced and feature an industry-leading design that provides proven longevity, performance, and efficiency. Complete combustion is the key, and these burners balance fuel and oxygen to generate a clean burn. Dual gas ports on the top and sides of each burner ensure even heating along the burner and produced fewer flare-ups. </p><h4>Instant JETFIRE Ignition </h4><p>If a grill doesn't reliably light, it's not a reliable grill. Napoleon's Instant JETFIRE ignition lights the first time, every time. The design sends a jet of flame to light each burner individually. You can light your grill with the twist of your writs. Batteries not required! With cross-lighting burners, in the unlikely event that a burner goes out or fails to light, it automatically relights. There's a cross-light bracket between burners that passes the flame to the unlit burner, assuring safe and reliable grilling. </p><h4>Dual-Level Stainless Steel Sear Plates</h4><p>Napoleon's sear plates help create the kind of BBQ flavor you love. When you grill, the plates are heated. As juices and sauces drip onto the plates, the drippings are vaporized to create smoke and steam that bathes the food in flavor. Additionally, the sear plates are staggered on multi-levels, creating even coverage across the grilling surface. This helps ensure even heating throughout your grill.</p><h4>7.5mm Stainless Steel Iconic Wave Cooking Grids </h4><p>Never underestimate the power of heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grids! As you can see, the Wave design is like no other, but it's not just because they look cool. The wave encourages even heating and provides more surface area, prevents food from falling through, and keeps the grill cleaner. The shape increases the grates' longevity by allowing for even expansion and contraction, reducing heat and cold's effect on the metal. </p><h3 class=pt10>Napoleon Built-in 500 Propane Grill FAQ</h3><h5>Can I convert the Built-in 500 propane grill to natural gas?</h5><p>Napoleon grills are gas specific and shouldn't be modified in any way.

The newly designed GENESIS gas grill features our largest and hottest sear zone, with secondary cooking grate so that the main course and sides are all grilled and served at the same time. Once your food is ready, easily transfer it to the large prep & serve table, making for a seamless prep-to-serve grilling experience. The <strong>grease management system</strong> got a facelift as well: the removable drip pan is now attached to the grease tray for seamless cleanup, with an included scraper just for good measure.</p><h3>Updated Control Panel: Cleaner Look, Better Precision</h3><p>Looks aren't everything, but they sure help. The newly designed Weber GENESIS E-435 gas grill sports a revamped control panel, starting with a slight angle for modern aesthetics and ease of use. The burner knobs follow suit, swapping the plastic construction from Weber Genesis II for metallicized knobs that lend a premium feel, not to mention greater durability. As a bonus, each knob is notched with small-spaced tick marks for more precise flame control. That brings us to the T-bar handle, which is shaped for easy gripping, opening, and closing from any angle. And speaking of angles, the T-handle's 90-degree corners enhance the modern look of Weber GENESIS gas grills.</p><h3>4 Stainless Steel Burners</h3><p>Get 48,000 BTUs of surface grilling power for a 646 square inch main grilling area. That's big enough to grill 28 burgers at a time!</p><h3>Side Burner</h3><p>Saute vegetables, boil corn, or heat up sauces with the 12,000 BTU side burner.</p><h3>Taller, Bolder Grill Lid</h3><p>Weber increased the height of these grill lids, a welcome change that goes beyond pure aesthetics. New GENESIS grills can fit rotisseries up to 10 in diameter without removing the top grate. It seems like a small detail, but it's just one more way the next generation of Weber GENESIS grills improve your outdoor cooking experience.</p><h3>The Ultimate Versatility of WEBER CRAFTED Grillware</h3><p>At this point, it would be fair to wonder if there was anything the Weber GENESIS E-435 propane grill is incapable of doing. Well, we have some big news on that front: compatibility with <a href={pathFor action='category' id='24149'}>WEBER CRAFTED Outdoor Kitchen Collection grillware</a> allows you to cook food never thought possible on a gas grill. Roast, bake, sear, steam, and even stir-fry by simply replacing the standard grate with any of the custom-fit grillware! And with the Weber GENESIS E-435 gas grill, you are already one step closer to the full backyard culinary experience thanks to the frame kit being built in (though the grillware itself is sold separately). </p><h3>Integrated Grill Locker</h3><p>A solution to all your grilling storage needs, the grill locker fits WEBER CRAFTED grillware, as well as your large grilling tools</p><h3>Upgraded Caster Wheels</h3><p>Weber reimagined everything for the new GENESIS grills, all the way down to the wheels. They've been upgraded to metal, rubber tread casters, as opposed to the pair of plastic locking casters on Genesis II grills. The rubber tread guarantees smooth transport, sturdier materials improve longevity, and the push-down lock mechanism lets you secure your grill in place with minimal effort.</p><h3>Longer Warranty</h3><p>Any Weber warranty, coupled with the company's outstanding track record of customer service, brings major peace of mind for backyard grillers. That being said, Weber extended their limited warranty to 12 years on the new GENESIS grills, as opposed to a 10-year period for Genesis II. Now THAT's peace of mind!</p><br><h3 class=pt10>Weber GENESIS E-435 FAQ</h3><h4>How big is the Weber GENESIS E-435 gas grill?</h4><p>The E-435 is 68.5-in wide with both shelves up, 27-in deep, and 48.5-in high.

That's not the case for the Blaze LBM, which includes heat zone separators that help you create varying levels of heat with each burner. Sear on one side, slow roast on the other, and do everything in between to make sure your guests leave satisfied. Plus, the removable warming rack is an ideal place to keep bread and other food heated while you grill. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area.

While it bakes deep-dish, flatbread, or any other pizza style that fits, its built-in vertical rotisserie and dual cooking racks allow you to prepare an impressive variety of dishes. Whether you're slow-cooking a pork butt (the oven can maintain a low temp of 270&deg;F), roasting a ham, baking cookies, or crafting a lasagna, this oven handles it all. From savory dinners to sweet desserts, the Blaze Outdoor Oven transforms your cooking possibilities.</p><h3>Vertical Rotisserie for Multi-Functional Cooking</h3><p>Explore new cooking methods with the vertical rotisserie. While a rotisserie chicken is sure to be a hit, the unique vertical design allows you to experiment like never before. Bring the Mediterranean to your backyard with juicy lamb gyros or keep it traditional with a low-and-slow pork butt. No matter what you are cooking though, nestle your vegetables in the included drip pan, and let them soak up all those delicious drippings for the perfect side dish.</p><h3>From Low-and-Slow to Searing Heat</h3><p>Tubular burners offer the capability to cook low-and-slow at 270&deg;F or rip as high as 550&deg;F while using the dual cooking racks. That's the kind of oven temperature range that allows for true cooking versatility.</p><p>And because the pizza stone is heated directly at the burners, its surface can reach 700&deg;F, which means crispy, restaurant-quality pizza in mere minutes or any other foods that require serious heat.</p><h3>360-Degree Rotating Pizza Stone</h3><p>Forget about having to stick your arm into a piping hot oven to twirl your pizza. The 17 ceramic pizza stone rotates at the push of a button, so your family pizza night can truly incorporate the kids. Plus, by evenly distributing the heat from the oven (and eliminating any annoying cold spots), the stone will both ensure total pizza perfection and provide an excellent surface to cook so many other dishes.</p><h3>Stylish Stainless Steel Construction</h3><p>Complete your outdoor kitchen and instantly enhance your living space with this sleek design. The Blaze Outdoor Oven is constructed of 304 stainless steel, making it durable, resistant to corrosion, and easy to clean. Backed by a lifetime warranty, it can handle a variety of cooking needs now and for years to come.</p><h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.</p><h3>Effortless by Design</h3><p>The Blaze LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for 70,000 BTUs.</p><p>Blaze outfitted the LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots&mdash;just consistent temperatures.</p><h3>New, Innovative Features</h3><p>Grill at any time with the LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze LTE+ is their best grill yet.</p><p>Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.</p><h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Featuring an innovative grilling system capable of cooking from a searing hot 900 degrees Fahrenheit, down to a low 200 degrees, great for low-heat smoking, searing, and everything in between. The TEC Patio FR 26-inch natural gas grill cooks with 100 percent infrared energy with no hot or cold spots, eliminating hot air and reducing moisture loss in food by up to 35 percent. The fuel efficient 30,000 BTU burner uses less fuel than other grills, saving you money on gas. Convenient electronic ignition supplies a reliable spark to ignite the burners safely. TEC uses a patented flare-proof stainless steel infrared burner system combined with a radiant glass emitter panel, resulting in tender, juicy, charbroil flavored food. The position of the stainless steel cooking grates, radiant glass panels, and infrared burners creates even heat distribution across the cooking surface and virtually eliminates flare-ups. The 296 square inch cooking surface is covered by unique, U-shaped cooking grates which heat very quickly, delivering restaurant-style sear marks on your food. TEC Patio grills are capable of heating up to 900 degrees in 10 minutes with the hood closed, making long preheating times are a thing of the past. The need for a side burner is also eliminated because you can place your pots or pans on the cooking grids or radiant panels to heat and cook like on an indoor cooktop. Enjoy quick and easy cleanup, with a self-cleaning cooking surface that incinerates food and debris in 10-15 minutes while the grill is on high. Handcrafted in America, this 26-inch built-in grill features a double-lined hood and thick gauge, 304 grade stainless steel with chrome control knobs.

It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve. The stainless steel grill hood is double lined, shielding the outer layer from heat discoloration while also keeping more heat where it matters most. This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. The stainless steel grill cart features two soft close front doors for storing your tank, grill cover and BBQ accessories. The cart also includes four heavy duty caster wheels, allowing you to relocate the grill easily whenever necessary, and two side shelves for a convenient work area. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.</p><h3>Effortless by Design</h3><p>The Blaze LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage. Beginning with startup, thanks to the Blaze push-and-turn flame-thrower ignition system that reliably lights in no time. And just in case, backup flashtube and crossover channels have you covered in the unlikely event of ignition trouble. Either way, the 5 cast stainless steel burners will be lit with impressive quickness, generating 14,000 BTUs apiece for 70,000 BTUs.</p><p>Blaze outfitted the LTE+ grill with patented triangular searing rods. Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots&mdash;just consistent temperatures.</p><h3>New, Innovative Features</h3><p>Grill at any time with the LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience. For added convenience, this Blaze LTE+ grill includes a removable warming rack for toasting buns or keeping cooked food warm until everything is ready to be served. And no need to worry about a mess as the removable, full-width drip tray makes cleanup simple. Add it all up, and this Blaze LTE+ is their best grill yet.</p><p>Please note that a 110V power source is required. Blaze LTE+ 5-Burner Gas Grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so if you ever need to switch from one gas to the other, you won't need to acquire a gas conversion kit.</p><h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

It's ready to meet any challenge with thicker cooking grates, a digital control panel, more accurate temperature readouts, rotisserie kit, and an incredibly useful warming rack that does much more than warm. These features only scratch the surface of what an incredible grill the LTE PRO is.</p><p>Like all Blaze gas grills, it's made of 304 stainless steel down to the cast stainless steel burners for impressive durability, a double-lined hood to prevent discoloration, and a reliable flame-thrower ignition.</p><p>Flexibility to cook any kind of food with four cooking zones. The four main natural gas burners each provide up to 14,000 BTUs of efficient grilling power, with an additional 10,000 BTUs from the rear burner, which is primarily for rotisserie use but can be used for warming.</p><p><strong>The Blaze LTE PRO has upgraded features that set it apart from the competition:</strong></p><h3>Spring-Assist Hood for Effortless Opening and Closing</h3><p>The hood has an ergonomic rotating, knurled H handle, and combined with spring assistance you'll find it's practically effortless to open and close the lid.</p><h3>Increased Hood Clearance for Larger Cuts of Meat</h3><p>Fit taller & larger items on the grill.

Featuring an innovative grilling system capable of cooking from a searing hot 900 degrees Fahrenheit, down to a low 200 degrees, great for low-heat smoking, searing, and everything in between. The TEC Sterling Patio FR 26-inch natural gas grill cooks with 100 percent infrared energy with no hot or cold spots, eliminating hot air and reducing moisture loss in food by up to 35 percent. The fuel efficient 30,000 BTU burner uses less fuel than other grills, saving you money on gas. Convenient electronic ignition supplies a reliable spark to ignite the burners safely. TEC uses a patented flare-proof stainless steel infrared burner system combined with a radiant glass emitter panel, resulting in tender, juicy, charbroil flavored food. The position of the stainless steel cooking grates, radiant glass panels, and infrared burners creates even heat distribution across the cooking surface and virtually eliminates flare-ups. The 296 square inch cooking surface is covered by unique, U-shaped cooking grates which heat very quickly, delivering restaurant-style sear marks on your food. TEC Sterling Patio grills are capable of heating up to 900 degrees in 10 minutes with the hood closed, making long preheating times are a thing of the past. The need for a side burner is also eliminated because you can place your pots or pans on the cooking grids or radiant panels to heat and cook like on an indoor cooktop. Enjoy quick and easy cleanup, with a self-cleaning cooking surface that incinerates food and debris in 10-15 minutes while the grill is on high. Handcrafted in America, this 26-inch built-in grill features a sleek, contoured double-lined hood and thick gauge, 304 grade stainless steel with red metal control knobs.

The Blaze LTE+ 32-inch Marine Grade built-in propane grill includes a new and improved features, plus a 316L stainless steel construction ideal for saltwater environments. It is also free of vulnerable weld spots, adding to the impressive durability grill masters deserve.

This LTE+ model also includes a hood assist mechanism that makes opening and closing easier than ever in addition to new, improved lighting, which remains on while in use, and LED illuminated control system with safety glow lighting. All backed by Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty.</p><h3>Effortless by Design</h3><p>The marine grade Blaze LTE+ makes cooking effortless at every stage.

Why does that matter? It is all in the design: a wide, flat bottom to soak up vast amounts of heat, along with a pointed top to channel it all to a single point of contact with food. The result is astounding sear marks that you would expect to find in a steakhouse. Beneath the grates rests a set of a full-width, 14-gauge stainless steel flame tamers that not only stop most flare-ups in their tracks, but also evenly distribute heat across the cooking surface. No more dreaded hot or cold spots&mdash;just consistent temperatures.</p><h3>New, Innovative Features</h3><p>Grill at any time with the LTE+ updated LED illuminated control system, a helpful yet stylish touch that makes the grill knobs shine red when in position. Pair that with improved interior lights and you're in for a more enjoyable cooking experience.

Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill professional if they didn't mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 3-burner propane grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its three 304 cast stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. </p><h3>Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-ups</h3><p>Above the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this built-in Blaze propane grill has all the makings of a luxury experience.</p> <h3>Easy to Fire Up and Adjust</h3><p>Startup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time.</p> <h3>Yes, Luxury Grilling is an Actual Thing</h3><p>Every aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX built-in 3-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.</p><h3>Sophisticated Design Meets Practicality</h3><p>When it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers. The built-in rear infrared burner awaits your slow-roasting recipes, and the waterproof rotisserie kit can be stored on included hanging hooks when not in use. The 615 square inches of total grilling space gives you plenty of room to play, and with a best-in-class, lifetime warranty you can grill without worry.

It's ready to meet any challenge with thicker cooking grates, a digital control panel, more accurate temperature readouts, rotisserie kit, and an incredibly useful warming rack that does much more than warm. These features only scratch the surface of what an incredible grill the LTE PRO is.</p><p>Like all Blaze gas grills, it's made of 304 stainless steel down to the cast stainless steel burners for impressive durability, a double-lined hood to prevent discoloration, and a reliable flame-thrower ignition.</p><p>Flexibility to cook any kind of food with five cooking zones. The five main natural gas burners each provide 14,000 BTUs of efficient grilling power, with an additional 10,000 BTUs from the rear burner, which is primarily for rotisserie use but can be used for warming.</p><p><strong>The Blaze LTE PRO has upgraded features that set it apart from the competition:</strong></p><h3>Spring-Assist Hood for Effortless Opening and Closing</h3><p>The hood has an ergonomic rotating, knurled H handle, and combined with spring assistance you'll find it's practically effortless to open and close the lid.</p><h3>Increased Hood Clearance for Larger Cuts of Meat</h3><p>Fit taller & larger items on the grill. In addition to more room for rotisserie cooking, the increased headroom allows for larger roasts - there's even enough room for a whole turkey!</p><h3>12 mm Hexagonal Grill Grates Intensify Searing</h3><p>If you haven't converted your life to the metric system yet, 12 mm is almost 1/2 an inch!  These grill grates are solid, cast stainless steel and offer superior heat retention to deliver steakhouse-level searing.</p><h3>Digital Control Panel with Temperature Readings</h3><p>The new digital screen displays accurate temperature operation for easy monitoring and control. The thermocouple is directly below the grill grates, which is significantly more accurate than hood thermometers. Two meat probes are included, and those temps will also be displayed on the digital panel.</p><h3>A Warming Rack That Does More Than Just Warm</h3><p>The much-improved warming rack features specialized holders for specific foods like tacos and chicken legs and includes stow-n-go capability to store your warming rack upright when not in use.</p><h3>Interior and Knob Lights for Convenience and Safety</h3><p>You'll enjoy the peace of mind that comes with the illuminated control system featuring safety glow LED lights with white temperature indicators that shine red when gas is flowing. In addition, the interior lighting helps you see how your cook is going after the sun goes down.</p><h3>Blaze Lifetime Warranty = Peace of Mind</h3> <p>The LTE PRO includes Blaze's best-in-class, lifetime warranty, so you can buy with confidence, knowing that it will last. The grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so switching from one gas to the other is quick and easy, and won't require a separate gas conversion kit.

The grill is certain to spice things up with a whopping 105,000 BTU of power on 1564 square inches of total cooking area. Six cast stainless steel burners are each lit with reliable Piezo igniters. The grates are built from solid stainless steel. The Diablo grill has a rear infrared burner, producing 15,000 BTUs, and comes with a rotisserie kit. The double lined grill hood is constructed from a single piece of 14 gauge 304 stainless steel for superior heat retention. Twin lights are built into the interior of the grill for easy night grills when hosting those late night neighborhood parties. ReliaBULL heat technology reduces hot and cold spots so that you can fully utilize the entire cooking surface. Use the rear infrared burner in conjunction with the stainless steel, motorized rotisserie and roast ribs, lamb, pork, or even a pineapple that is guaranteed to be the star of the party. There is a heavy duty thermometer in the hood of the grill to help monitor the internal temperature of the grill.

The patented SABER infrared cooking system allows you to cook up juicier and more flavorful meals than traditional systems that use dry convection air. The unique SABER cooking grates and infrared emitters prevent flare-ups and direct airflow away from the cooking surface, providing evenly distributed, indirect heat for maximum moisture retention while grilling. The cooking grates also catch any drippings and debris, protecting the burners and creating that familiar BBQ sizzle as foods are infused with more juicy flavor. Designed with fuel efficiency in mind, the SABER infrared cooking system delivers quality results faster than most gas grills while consuming 30-percent less fuel. The burners, emitters and grates are made of 304 commercial grade stainless steel, ensuring long-lasting performance in your outdoor kitchen. The SABER Elite 1500 32-inch propane gas grill features an all-304-grade stainless steel lid with mirror-polished edges and two internal halogen lights for night-time grilling. Three 8,000 BTU gas burners, provide evenly-distributed heat across a 500 square-inch cooking surface. An adjustable, stainless steel warming rack folds down to keep foods warm and can be folded away for additional space when using the inlcuded stainless steel rotisserie spit motor and spit rod. Precisely manage grilling temperatures across three cooking zones using individual LED illuminated burner control knobs, ensuring reliable start-up with integrated push-button electronic ignition. Three grate-level temperature gauges with annealed stainless steel bezels allow you to easily monitor grilling temperatures, even while the lid is lifted. Two 304-grade stainless steel side shelves provide convenient workspace with die-cast BBQ tool holders and a towel bar, as well as an integrated side-burner in the left shelf. The 18,000 BTU double ring side burner features dual control knobs so you can use a single burner ring for simmering, or crank up both burners to boil 15-quarts of water in as little as 18 minutes. Cleaning your SABER grill after meals is easy thanks to the 304 stainless steel burner boxes, firebox liners and front-access grease tray, simply burn off and brush away any remaining debris with the included grate scraper. The SABER EZ assembly cart features fully-enclosed, 304-grade stainless steel storage space with a condiment basket, stainless steel access doors with a roll-out tank tray and heavy-duty, nylon locking casters for easy placement. When your SABER Elite grill is not in use, you can confidently protect it against the outdoor elements with the included marine-grade cover.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Choice Series grills are the most affordable line that Fire Magic offers, featuring superior design and materials inside Aurora-style housing. In addition to the standard premium features, the new Multi-User Accessible collection of Choice series grill includes several features designed to withstand frequent use in areas like resorts and condos. They also feature a suite of enhancements designed to assist individuals with disabilities. The CMA430S freestanding natural gas grill is constructed of 304 stainless steel for long lasting quality, with a satin finish and comfort touch knobs on a sleek and simple control panel. The modified control knobs are easier to manipulate and are made with locking pins as an anti-theft measure. As an accessibility upgrade, the hood is spring assisted, and includes a handle on the side for easy opening and closing. Integrated into the hood are a wind guard to prevent airflow into the exhaust vent, and an analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, two 16-gauge stainless steel tubular burners provide 46,000 BTUs. These burners are lit by reliable Rapid Light ignition that requires no battery or external power. Flavor grids protect the burners from grease and debris, while also spreading heat evenly to the cooking surface. The 432 sq. inch cooking surface is comprised of patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which feature a trapezoidal shape that optimally transfers heat from the fire to your food. They are locked into place by the face panel to prevent theft. An adjustable warming rack adds extra space for keeping food hot, and is also locked for theft prevention. The disposable drip pan system makes cleanup easy. Raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for seamless built-in installation. The grill is mounted to a sturdy in-ground post, perfect for permanent installation in courtyard or outdoor gathering space. For the Accessible collection, the grill is lower on the post mount than on normal Choice grills, with the cooking surface sitting at 32 inches high instead of 37. As an added safety feature, this unit includes a 1-hour automatic gas shut-off timer. This is perfect for common use areas where users might forget to shut off the burners. In addition, the operating instructions for the grill are laser etched onto the control panel face so that they can never be misplaced. All of these design enhancements back up a strong 5 year limited warranty. Designed with frequent use and abuse in mind, and with enhanced accessibility, the Choice Multi-User Accessible collection of grills from Fire Magic is the perfect luxury option for any common use area.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

It's ready to meet any challenge with thicker cooking grates, a digital control panel, more accurate temperature readouts, rotisserie kit, and an incredibly useful warming rack that does much more than warm. These features only scratch the surface of what an incredible grill the LTE PRO is.</p>&#10;<p>Like all Blaze gas grills, it&#146;s made of 304 stainless steel down to the cast stainless steel burners for impressive durability, a double-lined hood to prevent discoloration, and a reliable flame-thrower ignition.</p>&#10;<p>Flexibility to cook any kind of food with five cooking zones. The five main propane burners each provide 14,000 BTUs of efficient grilling power, with an additional 10,000 BTUs from the rear burner, which is primarily for rotisserie use but can be used for warming.</p>&#10;<p>The 304 stainless steel cart includes updated handles, foldable side shelves, an interior shelf, a roll-out shelf for a propane tank, and even interior lights for improved visibility. The doors have soft-close hinges for smooth operation, and the four heavy-duty locking casters make it easier to move and help ensure it stays put.</p>&#10;<p><strong>The Blaze LTE PRO has upgraded features that set it apart from the competition:</strong></p>&#10;<h3>Spring-Assist Hood for Effortless Opening and Closing</h3>&#10;<p>The hood has an ergonomic rotating, knurled &#147;H&#148; handle, and combined with spring assistance you&#146;ll find it&#146;s practically effortless to open and close the lid.</p>&#10;<h3>Increased Hood Clearance for Larger Cuts of Meat</h3>&#10;<p>Fit taller & larger items on the grill. In addition to more room for rotisserie cooking, the increased headroom allows for larger roasts &ndash; there&#146;s even enough room for a whole turkey&#33;</p>&#10;<h3>12 mm Hexagonal Grill Grates Intensify Searing</h3>&#10;<p>If you haven't converted your life to the metric system yet, 12 mm is almost 1/2 an inch!  These grill grates are solid, cast stainless steel and offer superior heat retention to deliver steakhouse-level searing.</p>&#10;<h3>Digital Control Panel with Temperature Readings</h3>&#10;<p>The new digital screen displays accurate temperature operation for easy monitoring and control. The thermocouple is directly below the grill grates, which is significantly more accurate than hood thermometers. Two meat probes are included, and those temps will also be displayed on the digital panel.</p>&#10;<h3>A Warming Rack That Does More Than Just Warm</h3>&#10;<p>The much-improved warming rack features specialized holders for specific foods like tacos and chicken legs and includes stow-n-go capability to store your warming rack upright when not in use.</p>&#10;<h3>Interior and Knob Lights for Convenience and Safety</h3>&#10;<p>You&#146;ll enjoy the peace of mind that comes with the illuminated control system featuring safety glow LED lights with white temperature indicators that shine red when gas is flowing. In addition, the interior lighting helps you see how your cook is going after the sun goes down.</p>&#10;<h3>Blaze Lifetime Warranty &#61; Peace of Mind</h3> &#10;<p>The LTE PRO includes Blaze&#146;s best-in-class, lifetime warranty, so you can buy with confidence, knowing that it will last. The grill includes interchangeable propane and natural gas orifices, so switching from one gas to the other is quick and easy, and won&#146;t require a separate gas conversion kit.

The Blaze Professional LUX 4-burner propane grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its 4 cast 304 stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. </p><h3>Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-ups</h3><p>Above the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this Blaze grill has all the makings of a luxury experience.</p><h3>Easy to Fire Up and Adjust</h3><p>Startup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time.</p><h3>Smart Engineering & Stylish Elegance</h3><p>Every aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX built-in grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.</p><h3>Sophisticated Design Meets Practicality</h3><p>When it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers. The built-in rear infrared burner awaits your slow-roasting recipes, and the waterproof rotisserie kit can be stored on included hanging hooks when not in use. The 1,050 square inches of total grilling space gives you plenty of room to play, and with a best-in-class, lifetime warranty you can grill without worry.

Featuring an innovative grilling system capable of cooking from a searing hot 900 degrees Fahrenheit, down to a low 200 degrees, great for low-heat smoking, searing, and everything in between. The TEC Patio FR 44-inch natural gas grill cooks with 100 percent infrared energy with no hot or cold spots, eliminating hot air and reducing moisture loss in food by up to 35 percent. Two fuel efficient 30,000 BTU burners use less fuel than other grills, saving you money on gas. Convenient electronic ignition supplies a reliable spark to ignite the burners safely. TEC uses a patented flare-proof stainless steel infrared burner system combined with a radiant glass emitter panel, resulting in tender, juicy, charbroil flavored food. The position of the stainless steel cooking grates, radiant glass panels, and infrared burners creates even heat distribution across the cooking surface and virtually eliminates flare-ups. The 592 square inch cooking surface is covered by unique, U-shaped cooking grates which heat very quickly, delivering restaurant-style sear marks on your food. A stainless steel heat zone separator sits between the burners, which allows you to cook food simultaneously using different temperatures. The separator prevents heat from spilling over to the other side, allowing you to cook using indirect heat. TEC Patio grills are capable of heating up to 900 degrees in 10 minutes with the hood closed, making long preheating times are a thing of the past. The need for a side burner is also eliminated because you can place your pots or pans on the cooking grids or radiant panels to heat and cook like on an indoor cooktop. Enjoy quick and easy cleanup, with a self-cleaning cooking surface that incinerates food and debris in 10-15 minutes while the grill is on high. Handcrafted in America, this 44-inch built-in grill features a double-lined hood and thick gauge, 304 grade stainless steel with red metal control knobs. All TEC grills are CSA certified.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

This 36-inch natural gas built-in grill features three 25,000 BTU U-shaped stainless steel burners that push an impressive total of 75,000 BTUs of cooking power. Each burner features a heat shield that directs heat upwards, maximizing grilling efficiency. DCS grills offer Ceramic Radiant Technology, which is a layer of ceramic rods placed between the burners and cooking grate. The rods provide intense, yet even heat, ensuring the temperature is consistent across the entire grilling surface. This innovative feature allows you to sear meat to perfection anywhere on the cooking grid. This grill boasts a 638 square inch main cooking surface with durable, double-sided cast stainless steel cooking grids. One side has a gentle curve which supports and handles fish and vegetables. The other side of the grates accommodates steaks and other cuts of meat, capturing grease while creating perfect sear lines. DCS BH1 grills feature a wider range of cooking temperatures with valves that can be turned down to as low as 300 degrees at the grilling surface. The patented Grease Management system effectively channels grease and oil away from the flame while grilling, which greatly reduces flare-ups. The 14,000 BTU infrared rear burner functions perfectly for slow-roasting, and the included rotisserie kit can accommodate up to 50 lbs! The smoker tray is welded closed so you can add your favorite wine or beer into the tray. A dedicated 3,500 BTU smoker burner allows the wood chips to slowly smolder for more layers of flavor. The removable warming rack features a spacious 241 square inch, stainless steel warming area. The push and turn 9-volt battery ignition operates with the ease of an indoor range, and the 40-watt halogen Smart Beam BBQ grill light adds visibility while you grill. The temperature gauge allows you to control cooking temperatures. Every DCS grills is handcrafted and constructed entirely of heavy gauge, type 304 stainless steel.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Our friends at Blaze would not call a grill professional if they didn't mean it. The Blaze Professional LUX 3-burner natural gas grill lives up to its billing on all fronts, starting with commercial-grade stainless steel construction across the board. Its three 304 cast stainless steel burners are produced in the signature H style, giving them a heavy-duty feel to match their unquestionable durability and 18,000 BTUs each. </p><h3>Steakhouse-level Sear Marks and Minimal Flare-ups</h3><p>Above the burners rests 12mm-thick stainless steel hexagon-shaped grill grates that provide maximum heat retention in service of staggering sear marks. With 12-gauge flame tamer grids thrown into the mix to minimize flare-ups, this freestanding Blaze natural gas grill has all the makings of a luxury experience.</p> <h3>Easy to Fire Up and Adjust</h3><p>Startup is just as effortless as cooking, with a Push & Turn Flame-Thrower ignition system for steady, reliable flames at the turn of a knob. The Backup Flashtube & Crossover Channels, meanwhile, function as secondary ignitors so you will never be left without a flame. Heat zone separators border each burner, establishing distinct cooking zones to improve cooking versatility like never before. Add it all up, and you will produce professional-level results time after time.</p> <h3>Yes, Luxury Grilling is an Actual Thing</h3><p>Every aspect of the Blaze Professional LUX freestanding 3-burner grill is designed with a luxury experience in mind. Take its internal halogen lights, for instance: they shine brightly so you can grill boldly, even after the sun has set. Blaze's signature red LED Illuminated Control System pitches in during nighttime grilling as well, while also adding a subtle sense of style to the proceedings. And if style is indeed what you are after, the Blaze Professional LUX stainless steel grill hood features a sleek, contoured edge - along with a double lining that wards off heat discoloration to maintain a brand-new look no matter how often you grill.</p><h3>Sophisticated Design Meets Practicality</h3><p>When it comes to convenience, good luck finding a spot where it was not considered. Cleanup is as smooth as the grill's design thanks to a full-width drip pan on rollers. The built-in rear infrared burner awaits your slow-roasting recipes, and the waterproof rotisserie kit can be stored on included hanging hooks when not in use. The 615 square inches of total grilling space gives you plenty of room to play, and with a best-in-class, lifetime warranty you can grill without worry. Professional, indeed!</p><h3>Fully-Loaded Grill Cart</h3><p>A grill this awesome simply can't be contained... sometimes literally. To help you spread your wings as a grill master, Blaze designed a decked-out grill cart on 4 heavy-duty, locking wheels that make relocating the grill as easy as searing on the extra-thick cooking grates. The cart is built from high-quality stainless steel for years of outdoor use and features 2 side shelves that allow you to prep everything without leaving the backyard, then fold down when not in use to save valuable storage space. And speaking of storage, the freestanding Blaze Professional LUX 4-burner natural gas grill comes with 2 internally lit drawers and a large soft close door to stash your BBQ tools and anything else you need for an enjoyable afternoon of grilling. The drawer LEDs require 4 AAA batteries to operate, so no transformer is needed. </p><p><strong>CSA Certified to the following Standard:</strong><br>CSA/AM ANSI Z21.58-2018/CSA 1.6-2018 (Fifth Edition) - Outdoor cooking gas appliances</p><h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Aurora A540I built-in natural gas grill features 540 square inches of premium cooking space, wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 63,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions.

The Alturi ALT36 gas grill is constructed from heavy duty 304 grade stainless steel for long lasting performance and durability. This 36-inch Built-In natural gas grill is equipped with three stainless steel U-shaped burners rated for 26,000 BTUs each. The 945 square inch cooking area is covered with 9mm thick, heavy-duty stainless steel cooking grates. A ceramic briquette tray system sits under the grates, which absorb radiant heat from the burners, ensuring the grill provides even heat across the cooking surface. Stainless steel heat zone separators placed between the burners prevent heat from bleeding over, allowing you to cook foods at different temperatures simultaneously or use the grill in a two zone setup, with one portion for direct, high heat cooking and the other for cooler indirect cooking. A double lined grill hood prevents heat discoloration and retains heat. This gas grill also boasts a 15,000 BTU rear infrared rotisserie burner for expanded cooking flexibility. The heavy-duty rotisserie kit can hold up to 100 pounds. Flame thrower ignition supported by a backup flush tube ensures safe, reliable lighting without the need for batteries or electricity. For additional convenience, this grill offers details such as LED front panel illumination, interior halogen lighting and a spring-assisted hood for effortless lifting.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The integrated rotisserie system has a 15,000 BTU rear ceramic infrared burner and a whisper-silent motor with a chain-driven spit that has 120 pounds of turning torque.

The patented SABER infrared cooking system allows you to cook up juicier and more flavorful meals than traditional systems that use dry convection air. The unique SABER cooking grates and infrared emitters prevent flare-ups and direct airflow away from the cooking surface, providing evenly distributed, indirect heat for maximum moisture retention while grilling. The cooking grates also catch any drippings and debris, protecting the burners and creating that familiar BBQ sizzle as foods are infused with more juicy flavor. Designed with fuel efficiency in mind, the SABER infrared cooking system delivers quality results faster than most gas grills while consuming 30-percent less fuel. The burners, emitters and grates are made of 304 commercial grade stainless steel, ensuring long-lasting performance in your outdoor kitchen. The SABER Elite 1670 40-inch propane gas grill features an all-304-grade stainless steel lid with mirror-polished edges and two internal halogen lights for night-time grilling. Four 8,000 BTU gas burners, provide evenly-distributed heat across a 670 square-inch cooking surface. An adjustable, stainless steel warming rack folds down to keep foods warm and can be folded away for additional space when using the inlcuded stainless steel rotisserie spit motor and spit rod. Precisely manage grilling temperatures across four cooking zones using individual LED illuminated burner control knobs, ensuring reliable start-up with integrated push-button electronic ignition. Four grate-level temperature gauges with annealed stainless steel bezels allow you to easily monitor grilling temperatures, even while the lid is lifted. Two 304-grade stainless steel side shelves provide convenient workspace with die-cast BBQ tool holders and a towel bar, as well as an integrated side-burner in the left shelf. The 18,000 BTU double ring side burner features dual control knobs so you can use a single burner ring for simmering, or crank up both burners to boil 15-quarts of water in as little as 18 minutes. Cleaning your SABER grill after meals is easy thanks to the 304 stainless steel burner boxes, firebox liners and front-access grease tray, simply burn off and brush away any remaining debris with the included grate scraper. The SABER EZ assembly cart features fully-enclosed, 304-grade stainless steel storage space with a condiment basket, two stainless steel drawers, single access door with a roll-out tank tray and heavy-duty, nylon locking casters for easy placement. When your SABER Elite grill is not in use, you can confidently protect it against the outdoor elements with the included marine-grade cover.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Aurora A430S freestanding propane gas grill features 432 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features two cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. The grill comes on a stainless steel cart which includes two storage doors, a slide-out propane tank, and two side shelves. One of these shelves folds down while the other contains a flush mounted 15,000 BTU side burner for extra cooking versatility. Locking casters keep the cart in place. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. </p> <h3>2 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner </h3> <p>The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 2 burners deliver 52,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area of 883 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! </p> <p>In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. </p> <h3>Stainless Steel Construction </h3> <p>Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. </p> <h3>Blue Knob Lighting </h3> <p>You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. </p> <h3>Interior Halogen Lighting </h3> <p>Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. </p> <h3>Rotisserie Spit Storage </h3> <p>Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included. </p> <h3>Made in the USA? You bet! </h3> <p>It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA. </p> <ul><li>Included Accessories - a $1,000+ Value!

This freestanding propane gas grill has a twin head cooking system for more grilling versatility. Sear the perfect steak using the infrared burner while you bake a cake on the conventional side. One side has four stainless steel tube burners that provide up to 48,000 BTUs of cooking power while the other side has two ceramic infrared burners that produce 24,000 BTUs, reaching high heat in seconds, and ideal for searing restaurant quality steaks. The two infrared burners have an 8,000 BTU stainless steel tube warming burner between them. The grill has stainless steel cooking grates with 825 square inches of main cooking area and 420 square inches across the stainless steel warming area for a total of 1245 square inches of cooking area. Easily turn the burners on with a flame thrower ignition for a reliable start up. The stainless steel wave cooking grids create the trademark Napoleon sear lines. The stainless steel, self-cleaning sear plates vaporize drippings, control flare ups and keep your food moist. The Prestige PRO 825 also has an 18,000 BTU stainless steel rear infrared burner for slow cooking with the rotisserie kit and a 17,000 BTU power side burner. An integrated wood chip smoker tray pulls out for easy filling and has a dedicated 8,000 BTU burner that creates delicious smoke flavor. The hood features an Accu-Probe temperature gauge, stainless steel end caps and retains heat for oven-like performance. The LED Spectrum Night Light control knobs have near limitless color options making your night time entertaining a breeze, and they glow red when a burner is in use while two interior lights illuminate the grilling surface. Clean up is a cinch with the full width removable drip pan. The stainless steel grill cart also features two pull-out drawers and double doors for storage and easy roll locking casters for moving the grill around. Minimal assembly is required because the grill cart comes fully assembled with the exception of the cart side shelves and the grill head. Please note, due to the weight of this item white glove delivery service is not available.

The two burners push 46,000 BTUs of total cooking power on the grilling surface. An advanced ignition system uses a hot element positioned directly above the burner port for reliably safe start-up to the 600 square-Inch main cooking grid while a secondary grid provides an additional 240 square-inches for a comprehensive 840 square-inches of overall grilling space. The Lynx L30ATRF-LP also has a dual-position internal rotisserie with heavy-duty, 3-speed motor and rear infrared burner to raise your cooking options to their full potential.

The Aurora A660I built-in natural gas grill features 660 square inches of premium cooking space wrapped in a stylish, modern package that is built to last. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting. The double walled, spring assisted hood opens 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. It features an integrated analog thermometer with an angled bezel for easier viewing. Inside, this grill features three cast stainless steel E-burners, made with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting, that combine for 75,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. These flavor grids have attached heat zone separators, allowing you to create independent heat zones at the surface of the grill for varied cooking options. The cooking surface consists of the patented Diamond Sear cooking grids. These grids feature a matte, non-stick surface, and a trapezoidal shape that efficiently transfers heat from the burner to the wide surface of the cooking grids. The warming rack above can be adjusted and moved out of the way when not in use. In the rear of the grill is an 18,000 BTU stainless steel infrared backburner for the included heavy-duty rotisserie kit. For night time grilling, the interior of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Featuring an innovative grilling system capable of cooking from a searing hot 900 degrees Fahrenheit, down to a low 200 degrees, great for low-heat smoking, searing, and everything in between. The TEC Patio FR 44-inch propane gas grill cooks with 100 percent infrared energy with no hot or cold spots, eliminating hot air and reducing moisture loss in food by up to 35 percent. Two fuel efficient 30,000 BTU burners use less fuel than other grills, saving you money on gas. Convenient electronic ignition supplies a reliable spark to ignite the burners safely. TEC uses a patented flare-proof stainless steel infrared burner system combined with a radiant glass emitter panel, resulting in tender, juicy, charbroil flavored food. The position of the stainless steel cooking grates, radiant glass panels, and infrared burners creates even heat distribution across the cooking surface and virtually eliminates flare-ups. The 592 square inch cooking surface is covered by unique, U-shaped cooking grates which heat very quickly, delivering restaurant-style sear marks on your food. A stainless steel heat zone separator sits between the burners, which allows you to cook food simultaneously using different temperatures. The separator prevents heat from spilling over to the other side, allowing you to cook using indirect heat. TEC Patio grills are capable of heating up to 900 degrees in 10 minutes with the hood closed, making long preheating times are a thing of the past. The need for a side burner is also eliminated because you can place your pots or pans on the cooking grids or radiant panels to heat and cook like on an indoor cooktop. Enjoy quick and easy cleanup, with a self-cleaning cooking surface that incinerates food and debris in 10-15 minutes while the grill is on high. Handcrafted in America, this 44-inch freestanding grill features a double-lined hood and thick gauge, 304 grade stainless steel with red metal control knobs on a stainless steel pedestal base. All TEC grills are CSA certified.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Featuring an innovative grilling system capable of cooking from a searing hot 900 degrees Fahrenheit, down to a low 200 degrees, great for low-heat smoking, searing, and everything in between. The TEC Sterling Patio FR 44-inch natural gas grill cooks with 100 percent infrared energy with no hot or cold spots, eliminating hot air and reducing moisture loss in food by up to 35 percent. Two fuel efficient 30,000 BTU burners use less fuel than other grills, saving you money on gas. Convenient electronic ignition supplies a reliable spark to ignite the burners safely. TEC uses a patented flare-proof stainless steel infrared burner system combined with a radiant glass emitter panel, resulting in tender, juicy, charbroil flavored food. The position of the stainless steel cooking grates, radiant glass panels, and infrared burners creates even heat distribution across the cooking surface and virtually eliminates flare-ups. The 592 square inch cooking surface is covered by unique, U-shaped cooking grates which heat very quickly, delivering restaurant-style sear marks on your food. A stainless steel heat zone separator sits between the burners, which allows you to cook food simultaneously using different temperatures. The separator prevents heat from spilling over to the other side, allowing you to cook using indirect heat. TEC Sterling Patio grills are capable of heating up to 900 degrees in 10 minutes with the hood closed, making long preheating times are a thing of the past. The need for a side burner is also eliminated because you can place your pots or pans on the cooking grids or radiant panels to heat and cook like on an indoor cooktop. Enjoy quick and easy cleanup, with a self-cleaning cooking surface that incinerates food and debris in 10-15 minutes while the grill is on high. Handcrafted in America, this 44-inch built-in grill features a sleek, contoured double-lined hood and thick gauge, 304 grade stainless steel with chrome control knobs on a stainless steel pedestal base. All TEC grills are CSA certified.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The Aurora A830I built-in natural gas/charcoal combo grill combines the best of both worlds in outdoor cooking. 828 total square inches of cooking space (432 sq. in. on the gas side and 396 sq. in. on the charcoal side) provide an impressive amount of versatility that allows this masterpiece to truly shine. It features 304 stainless steel construction for lasting quality, and sleek styling with a seamless control panel that comes with comfort touch control knobs and LED backlighting on the gas side. Two separate double walled hoods feature spring assist hardware for ease and accessibility. They open 90 degrees for easier access and more efficient exhaust. Analog thermometers are integrated into both hoods, with angled bezels for easier viewing. The charcoal side features an adjustable height charcoal tray, letting you control the amount of heat that reaches the cooking surface. A 26,000 BTU burner below the charcoal tray is used to quickly ignite your charcoal or wood chunks. Both the gas and charcoal sides feature patented Diamond Sear cooking grids, which are designed with a trapezoidal shape to optimally transfer heat from the fire to your food. An adjustable warming rack also sits above the cooking surface on either side, for a little extra space to keep food hot while waiting for the rest to cook. Generating heat on the gas side are two cast stainless steel E-burners, with 1/4-inch thick walls and precision porting that combine for 50,000 BTUs. Reliable hot surface ignition always lights your burners where others might fail. Flash tubes serve as a backup. Flavor grids sit above the burners to spread heat evenly and protect the burners from debris and grease. For night time grilling, the interior of the gas side of the grill is lit by two halogen lights. A disposable drip tray system makes cleanup a breeze and reduces the chance of grease flareups. Solid, raised hangers line the sides and back of the grill for a seamless look when placed into a counter top or island. A 120 VAC power source is required for ignition, as well as for the lighting functions. With many of the same premium features as the Echelon series of grills, the Aurora series from Fire Magic is the perfect centerpiece for your luxury outdoor kitchen.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 30-inch grill has two (2) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.

The quality begins outside with gleaming, high-grade 304 stainless steel that is seamlessly welded to eliminate areas where grease and moisture can collect. A patented design deflects wind and allows the grill to vent properly, stabilizing critical surface temperatures when cooking in windy conditions. Inside, a 23,000 BTU Lynx Trident adjustable infrared burner allows you to sear thick-cuts perfectly or lower the temperature to cook more delicate items. Two 25,000 BTU ceramic burners deliver superior heat retention and delivery and will never rust or corrode. The three burners push 73,000 BTUs of total cooking power on the grilling surface. An advanced ignition system uses a hot element positioned directly above the burner port for reliably safe start-up and a large capacity smoker box allows you to add extraordinary flavor to all the things you like to grill. Over the burner, an array of fixed position ceramic briquettes ensures precise, even heat distribution to the 855 square-Inch main cooking grid while a secondary grid provides an additional 345 square-inches for a comprehensive 1,200 square-inches of overall grilling space. The Lynx L42TR-LP also has a dual-position internal rotisserie with heavy-duty, 3-speed motor and rear infrared burner to raise your cooking options to their full potential. Lynx made sure you have easy access to all these fine cooking features by adding lift assist and a handle that rotates fluidly as you raise and lower the hood. Like to grill into the night?

Crafted with precision to meet your highest grilling standards, loaded with the features you expect from a grill in the Luxury class. </p> <h3>3 Red Brass Burners, Plus an Infrared Back Burner </h3> <p>The Estate natural gas grill employs durable red brass burners, combined with ceramic briquette flame tamers to provide consistent heat (and, obviously, to reduce flare-ups). The 3 burners deliver 78,000 BTUs beneath a total grilling area over 1,000 square inches. You don't often see red brass used in grill burners, primarily because it's more expensive than stainless steel. And, let's face it, it looks cooler! </p> <p>In addition, you'll enjoy the back infrared burner, which puts out 20,000 BTUs to roast meats on the (included) rotisserie. </p> <h3>Stainless Steel Construction </h3> <p>Constructed with 304 stainless steel including heavy-duty 9 mm cooking grates, 18-gauge double-lined hood with spring assist and a full-width hood handle. the AMG Estate grill is built to last and give you years of reliable service. </p> <h3>Blue Knob Lighting </h3> <p>You should never have to guess at what levels your burners are set, especially after dark. The American Made Grill Estate series includes blue illumination above each knob to help you see what you're doing no matter the time of day. </p> <h3>Interior Halogen Lighting </h3> <p>Speaking of grilling at night, is there anything worse than opening the hood and not really seeing what's going on in there? With the Estate series, when you open the hood halogen lights illuminate your cooking surface. Never squint again or be tempted to get a closer look at the meat (and get an accidental suntan on your face) to see if it's ready to flip, or how close it is to done. </p> <h3>Stainless Steel Grill Cart with Ample Storage </h3> <p>Talk about grilling convenience! The Estate 42 Natural Gas Grill Cart features magnetic access door with 2-drawer storage, 2 collapsible shelves, tank storage, interior door condiment tray, ventilation, and locking caster wheels. It arrives <strong>fully assembled</strong>.</p> <h3>Rotisserie Spit Storage </h3> <p>Keep your rotisserie spit close by with integrated storage built into the grill. Rotisserie kit is included. </p> <h3>Made in the USA? You bet! </h3> <p>It's in the name: American Made Grills are built, tested, and serviced in the USA. </p> <ul><li>Included Accessories - a $1,000+ Value!

The Eagle One Series stands out from the crowd with an array of functional illumination upgrades, including continuous ambient control panel lighting in an attractive indigo blue. New Exact Control Illumination features a single LED above each burner control knob that changes color based on feedback from dedicated burner temperature sensors, indicating when each burner reaches warm, hot and searing temperatures. A TempTrack Illumination gauge above the control panel displays average overall grill temperature using a graduated series of LEDs, making it easy to know when your grill is ready for searing or when it has cooled enough to apply a grill cover after use. A concealed infrared rotisserie burner sits behind a black glass pane, allowing for a wider range of cooking temperatures and more evenly distributed heat across larger foods. Eagle One Series grills also have extra-large, 1/2-inch diameter hexagonal cooking grate rods for improved heat retention and extra food-to-surface contact. All metal components are made using premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue LED markers and a control indicator notch that illuminates to precisely indicate current settings. This 42-inch grill has two 25,000 BTU, 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers, letting you independently control the heat, one 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box.

Twin Eagles gas grills feature premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The Exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue line and a control indicator notch that illuminates to give a precise control setting. This 54-inch grill has three (3) 25,000 BTU 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers letting you independently control the heat, one (1) 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner, and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The 3/8 inch stainless steel hexagonal cooking grates offer more food-to-surface contact and allows more heat to be conducted into your food generating deeper and thicker restaurant-style sear marks. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has two independently controlled infrared rotisserie burners and fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. This grill cart is compatible with all Twin Eagles 54-inch built-in gas grills.

The Eagle One Series stands out from the crowd with an array of functional illumination upgrades, including continuous ambient control panel lighting in an attractive indigo blue. New Exact Control Illumination features a single LED above each burner control knob that changes color based on feedback from dedicated burner temperature sensors, indicating when each burner reaches warm, hot and searing temperatures. A TempTrack Illumination gauge above the control panel displays average overall grill temperature using a graduated series of LEDs, making it easy to know when your grill is ready for searing or when it has cooled enough to apply a grill cover after use. Two individually controlled concealed infrared rotisserie burners sit behind a black glass pane, allowing for a wider range of cooking temperatures and more evenly distributed heat across larger foods. Eagle One Series grills also have extra-large, 1/2-inch diameter hexagonal cooking grate rods for improved heat retention and extra food-to-surface contact. All metal components are made using premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue LED markers and a control indicator notch that illuminates to precisely indicate current settings. This 54-inch grill has three 25,000 BTU, 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers, letting you independently control the heat, one 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box.

The Eagle One Series stands out from the crowd with an array of functional illumination upgrades, including continuous ambient control panel lighting in an attractive indigo blue. New Exact Control Illumination features a single LED above each burner control knob that changes color based on feedback from dedicated burner temperature sensors, indicating when each burner reaches warm, hot and searing temperatures. A TempTrack Illumination gauge above the control panel displays average overall grill temperature using a graduated series of LEDs, making it easy to know when your grill is ready for searing or when it has cooled enough to apply a grill cover after use. Two individually controlled concealed infrared rotisserie burners sit behind a black glass pane, allowing for a wider range of cooking temperatures and more evenly distributed heat across larger foods. Eagle One Series grills also have extra-large, 1/2-inch diameter hexagonal cooking grate rods for improved heat retention and extra food-to-surface contact. All metal components are made using premium-grade stainless steel with seamless heli-arc welded construction for maximum strength and durability. The double-lined hood with hidden heavy-duty lift extension springs provides better durability, more insulation, and reduces the weight to make it easier for you to open and close. The exclusive Control Illumination control knobs feature highly visible, graduated indigo blue LED markers and a control indicator notch that illuminates to precisely indicate current settings. This 54-inch grill has three 25,000 BTU, 14 gauge 304 grade stainless steel main burners with zone dividers, letting you independently control the heat, one 25,000 BTU infrared sear burner and high quality ceramic briquette flame tamers that distribute the radiant heat more evenly across the cooking surface. The two position heavy-duty rotisserie system has a fully integrated motor with 100 pound turning capacity and a chain-driven design providing consistent and uniform rotation of the rotisserie rod. The rotisserie rod conveniently stores in the drip tray handle when not in use. This grill has a reliable hot surface ignition, interior lights with hood-activated light switch for nighttime grilling, three-position warming rack that conveniently stows away when not in use, and a large capacity sealed smoker box. The grill cart features heavy duty stainless steel construction with a sleek professional style to compliment the Twin Eagles grills and accessories. This cart has two self-latching storage drawers and one soft-closing access door that feature a flush handle design with high polished accents and concealed hinges. Use the handy pull-out tray inside the door to easily store a propane tank or a trash receptacle. The two stainless steel side shelves keep your BBQ tools at hand, provide a convenient work area while you cook, and fold down to save space when not in use. The heavy-duty casters have front brakes allowing you to easily relocate and secure the grill whenever necessary. Twin Eagles products are designed and manufactured in the USA with pride.<h3 class=\"h4 m-b-0\">Legal disclaimers and warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"m-t-0\">Product packaging, owners\u2019 manuals, installation instructions, and/or operating instructions may include more information than what is shown on our website.
